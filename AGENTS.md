# ai-dotfiles

Personal [opencode](https://opencode.ai) configuration — agents, skills, MCPs, and a peer-programming workflow.

[📖 Read the docs](https://bdbch.github.io/ai-dotfiles/)

## Quick Install

```bash
sh ./installers/opencode.sh
```

This symlinks your opencode config to the repo and installs dependencies:

```
~/.config/opencode/
├── opencode.jsonc      → symlinked
├── opencode.base.json  → symlinked
├── AGENTS.md           → symlinked (instructions/README.md — the coding guidelines hub)
├── instructions/       → symlinked (split conventions: coding, design, docs, etc.)
├── agents/             → symlinked
├── skills/             → symlinked
└── .secrets/           → real dir (tokens stay out of repo)
```

See the [installation guide](https://bdbch.github.io/ai-dotfiles/install/) for full instructions.

## Agents

11 focused agents live in [`agents/*.md`](agents/). Each file has YAML frontmatter with a `description`, `mode`, and `permission` settings.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `build-code` | Code writing — vibe mode (fast) or iterative mode (step-by-step) |
| `build-pair` | Read-only pair programming partner |
| `build-mentor` | Coding mentor — guides, explains, never writes code (multilingual) |
| `explore` | Codebase exploration — structure, patterns, code map, data, dependencies |
| `explore-ask` | Q&A coding buddy — answers questions, thinks along |
| `plan` | Feature, architecture, and refactoring planning |
| `plan-milestone` | Milestone and release planning |
| `review-code` | Code review — quality, TypeScript types, API DX |
| `review-security` | Security audit — vulnerabilities, auth, data handling |
| `review-design` | Visual design review — layout, typography, interaction |
| `orchestrator` | Project manager — delegates to agents, tracks progress, reports status |

To add a new agent, create a `.md` file in `agents/` with YAML frontmatter (`description`, `mode`, `permission`).
